## ***Mastering Markdown***

###### ***What is Markdown?***
- _Markdown_ is a way to style text on the web.
- A way to control the display of the document
###### ***Ways to display your document***
- Formatting words as **Bold** or *Italic.*
- Adding images and creating lists but there are many more that you could do.
###### _You can use Markdown most places around Github:_
- [Gists](https://gist.github.com/)
- Comments in Issues and Pulll Requests
- Files with the *.md* or *.markdown* extension
- You can view more information on [*"Writing on GitHub"*](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github) in the ***GitHub Help.***

## ***Examples***
#### *Text*
- You can make words **Bold** ( ** ), *italic* ( * ), and you can even [link to google](http://google.com)

#### *Lists*
- You could even *number*, *bullet point*, and *dash* your list also. ***Just like my notes hehe***

#### *Images*
- Adding images in markdown is like the same process of adding a link but add ( **!** ) before inserting image.

#### ***Headers & Quotes***
- ( **#** ) is used to *Structure* your documents
- Super useful to have different levels of headings to organize you documents.
- You can use multiple headings (up to six) to change it's size of the font.
- To *Quote* use the **>** character before the line.
- > You are a *Gift* from *God.* What you become is a *Gift* to *God.*
> *-Unknown*

#### ***Code***
- There are many different ways to style code with *GitHub's* markdown.
- If you have *Inline code blocks* you could wrap them in backticks.
- This character ( **`** ) is a backtick. ***Example*** 

`var example = true`
- If you got a longer block of code you can indent with four spaces. ***Example***

```
if (isAwesome){
    return true
}
```
- If you'd like to use syntax highlight, include the langauge like *javascript* for example. (**```javascript**)
